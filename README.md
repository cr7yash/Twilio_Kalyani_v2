Super easy script to send myself these reminders using Twilio's WhatsApp API ->

- Don't give up Kalyani...You have come too far for that.
   1. Learn from your mistakes
   2. Don't repeat your mistakes

   Remember that time back in 2014 when you learned how to write code for the first time? Remember that feeling?How would the 17 year old Kalyani react if she learns how fragile you've become?It'll all be fine. It'll all be great. Don't you worry. Believe in yourself!

- Stretch, lift weights, drink water, bathe, eat, relax.

- Go to sleep now. You can work again in the morning. No harm will be done. Less time will be wasted.
